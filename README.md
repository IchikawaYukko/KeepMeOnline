# Keep Me Online
The device acts as USB keyboard, it keeps you online. (For Slack, Microsoft Teams etc...)

This device automatically hits [Scroll Lock] key twice in every 60 seconds.

Why twice?: Some application, For example Microsoft Excel's behavior is depends on [Scroll Lock] state. So, press twice, will cancel the effect [Scroll Lock] state changes.
